ðŸ’¡ Reflection

Working on this project was an exciting learning experience.
I faced challenges while setting up Supabase because it was totally new for me, but I learned how to connect it with my JavaScript frontend and manage data securely.
I also learned to use environment variables (.env) and .gitignore to keep secret keys safe.

This project helped me understand how frontend logic, databases, and APIs work together in real-world applications.
